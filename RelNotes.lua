== General enhancements ==
* It's basically a OrderHallCommander clone
* Mission panel is movable (position not saved, it's jus to see things, panel is so huge...)
* Success chance extimation shown in mission list (optionally considering only available followers)
* Proposed party buttons and mission autofill
* "What if" switches to change party composition based on criteria
